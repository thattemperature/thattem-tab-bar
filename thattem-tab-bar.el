;;; Commentary:

;; Thattem-tab-bar is a package that change the appearance of the
;; default tab bar.  It DO NOT change the items used in tab bar,
;; like "tab-bar-format-tabs".  Instead, it defines replacement
;; for the items, like "thattem-tab-bar-format-tabs".
;;
;; The package will set "tab-bar-format" to use those replacement
;; as default.  You can also customize this variable.
